     Soil liquefaction occurs during earthquakes when the shaking causes soil to lose its strength, leading to damage to structures built on top. In this article, we will explore its causes, effects, prevention, and mitigation, emphasizing the importance of understanding it for safe and resilient infrastructure in earthquake-prone areas.

          Soil liquefaction occurs when there is movement between the tectonic plates, causing the soul to lose its strength, from which it acts like a liquid and has liquid properties. Water fills all spaces left between individual particles when soil is saturated, as stated by Dr Stavroula Kontoe of Imperial College London. The water pressure between soil particles is increased by seismic shaking; this can cause the particles to lose contact with one another, ultimately resulting in soil stiffness and strength loss. This is a simple definition of what soil liquefaction is.
